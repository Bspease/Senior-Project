# Senior-Project

“The Traveling Musician” is the name of the device that travels up and down any piano and plays music. After setting it up, the traveler will start playing the song programmed into it after a
button press until the song has been completed.

This was my 2021 Summer-Fall Senior Project to create a musical device that can play a piano to some degree.
